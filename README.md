# SolOS Package Repository
Packages here can be downloaded and installed with the use of SolOS Installer.
However, you can download a package from here seperately. You may want to do this if you want to download for a different
version of SolOS. 

# Delay
It will probably take a while to get any files here, as the package management system is not ready, and you will not find it in any release yet.
